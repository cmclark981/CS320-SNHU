How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By testing often and building code using an iterative method. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Undserstaing user requirements takes communication. Interviewing stakeholders to gain insight 
into thier needs and expectations allow developers to better understand the requirements 
as well as moderate expectations. Building on that will allow for better outcomes. 


How do I approach designing software?
I prefer to take in what the client needs through communication and discussion. Then using 
appropriate diagrams we can build on what we know. Using an iterative approach we can be 
certain to find and correct issues on smaller levels before reaching implementation.
